wp-updater-xfce
Wallpaper Auto Updater by Aaron Blakely <aaron@ephasic.org>

This script will auto update your XFCE backdrop with a random image
from a defined directory at a defined interval.

This code is public domain.  You are free to modify or do whatever
you want wit it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing:
	chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh


Troubleshooting:
	If the auto-runner doesn't seem to work, it could be
	that there is still an old lock file in /tmp.  Just
	remove /tmp/wp-updater.lock and try it again.

	The lock exists because if this script is ran from
	your bashrc, everytime you login (virtual term, ssh, etc)
	a new process would be spawned which is not good.

Bugs:
	I've only tested this on xubuntu.
	If you experience any problems regaurding this script
	on other distros, feel free to contact me.
